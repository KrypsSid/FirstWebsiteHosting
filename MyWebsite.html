                                                        mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content 
                                                        to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of
                                                        monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge  
                                                        of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the 
                                                        new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way 
                                                        but even the environment itself can defeat you. </p> </th>
